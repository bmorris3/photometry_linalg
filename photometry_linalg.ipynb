    "\n",
    "Photometry from spacecraft are rarely \"clean\". The photometry often comes to the astronomer pre-reduced by the mission team with various trends embedded in the photometry which need to be removed before one can successfully measure the astrophysical signal of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a non-exhaustive list of the signals and noise that we expect in the CHEOPS photometry\n",
    "1. Trends with time: spacecraft orbital phase, Sun angle, roll angle, temperature trends\n",
    "2. Trends with stellar centroid position on detector: `x`, `y`, cross-terms (`x*y`)\n",
    "3. Astrophysical signals of interest: transit, phase curve, secondary eclipse\n",
    "\n",
    "## What gets delivered from CHEOPS\n",
    "\n",
    "You get handed a bunch of FITS files that contain *record arrays*, which are matrices with labeled columns. The columns are things like: \n",
    "* times (BJD, UTC, etc.)\n",
    "* roll angle\n",
    "* stellar centroid position on detector\n",
    "* contamination parameter\n",
    "* **flux** and uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you already know\n",
    "\n",
    "For a known transiting system, which make up the bulk of the CHEOPS schedule, you already know the planet-to-star radius ratio $R_p/R_\\star$ and the mid-transit time $t_0$, so you can easily create a transit model which describes the expected astrophysical signal.\n"
